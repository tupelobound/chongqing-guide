Chongqing City Guide

This project started out as a basic HTML-only page that was my first foray into the world of web development.

As I discovered CSS, Bootstrap, JavsScript and JQuery I added styling and functionality to the page.

The page is very close to my heart, as it serves as a reminder of the city I spent five years living and working, and is the place where I met my wife!
